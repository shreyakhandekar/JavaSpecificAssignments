The File class is an abstract representation of file and directory pathname. A pathname can be either absolute or relative.

The File class have several methods for working with directories and files such as creating new directories or files, deleting and renaming directories or files, listing the contents of a directory etc.
The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is inherently system-dependent. When an abstract pathname is converted into a pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of the default separator character. The default name-separator character is defined by the system property file.separator, and is made available in the public static fields separator and separatorChar of this class. When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system.
